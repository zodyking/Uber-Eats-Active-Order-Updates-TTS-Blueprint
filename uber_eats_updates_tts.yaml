    ### Uber Eats Active Order Updates TTS Blueprint

    ![Uber Eats Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zodyking/uber-eats-order-tracker/main/image.png)

    This blueprint creates an automation that announces changes to Uber Eats order sensors when an active order is detected.  
    It triggers on updates to order stage, driver name, driver ETA, driver location, and active order status,  
    and uses TTS to speak customized messages.

    **Version:** 1.2  

    **Key Features:**  

    * Announces new orders with restaurant name.  

    * Announces when a driver is assigned.  

    * Announces order stage changes (picked up, en route, arriving, delivered).  

    * Announces driver location updates with cross street and ETA (includes an adjustable delay to avoid frequent announcements).  

    * Queued mode to avoid overlapping TTS playback.  

    **Requirements:**  

    * Uber Eats Order Tracking integration installed and configured.  

    * A TTS engine configured in Home Assistant (e.g., Google Translate TTS).  

    * A media player entity (e.g., `media_player.brandons_bedroom`) to play announcements.  

    **Important Notes:**  

    * The blueprint exposes inputs (entity IDs / TTS engine / media player / volume / delay) that must be filled when creating the automation from the blueprint.  

    * Ensure your Uber Eats sensors update their **state** (not only attributes) — this blueprint uses `trigger: state` triggers.  

    * The driver-location delay is adjustable to reduce announcement spam; tune as desired.  

    * This description block is informational only — the automation logic below remains unchanged.
